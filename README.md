# Fitness Tracker Web App
## Description
A simple fitness tracker web application with authentication and user data.

## Developer tools/languages

### Backend
*Django*

Chosen due to its built in authentication and robust toolset. Also, I wanted to use Python for the backend this time.

### Frontend
*Vue.js*

Chosen because I am used to using React, and want to compare the developer experience of both frameworks.

### Database
*Postgres*

Its a classic choice that meets my needs and I am familiar with.
